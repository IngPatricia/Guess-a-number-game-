# Guess-a-number-game-
Let´s guess a number! :four_leaf_clover:  

## How it started 
On my attempt of learning python, I went on watching tutorials and reading some blogs and trying to understand how the syntax works as oppose to Java. 
So I cam up with this little game, I got inspired, and changed colours, added a image, and played around as I did not want to limit myself from what I saw online. 

### What is about
You start by guessing a number from 1 to 99, and *click* on the check buttom which then tell you bellow if you must go down or up in order to win. 
If you have enough attempts, you can keep going until you run out, win,  or you can quit by *clicking* on the next button. 

### Cool features 
When you hover over the text box you cursor changes to a heart ❤!!

### Future plans 
* You would see some uncommented code as I was trying to make an image appear right after you *win*, but for now that what I got!
* I will like to provide the user with another option for adding/multiplying numbers 

### Conclusion 
Not bad for my first attempt! Now it is time to learn more about python! If you'd like to modify it, we could team up :)
