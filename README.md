# Guess-a-number-game-
Let´s guess a number! :four_leaf_clover:  

## How it started 
On my attempt of learning python, I went on watching tutorials, and reading some blogs to understand(try to) how the syntax works as oppose to Java. 
So I got inspired, and came up with this little game. Changed colours, added a image, and played around as I did not want to limit myself from what I saw online or to make it too similiar to the examples. 

## Tech
I used python 3.9 and Intelij to create this game.

### What is about - how to play 
You start by guessing a number from 1 to 99, and *click* on the check buttom. It *tells* you if you must go down or up in order to win.

* Example one - go down

* Example two - go up

If you have enough attempts, you can keep going until you run out, win,  or you can quit by *clicking* on the next button. 

* Example three- You win

### Cool features 
When you hover over the text box you cursor changes to a heart ❤!!

### Future plans 
* You would see some uncommented code as I was trying to make an image appear right after you *win*, but for now that what I got!
* I will like to provide the user with another option for adding/multiplying numbers 

### Conclusion 
Not bad for my first attempt! Now it is time to learn more about python! If you'd like to modify it, we could team up :)
